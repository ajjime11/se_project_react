Overview
Welcome to my first project using React! This is a major milestone in my journey through the TripleTen Software Engineering bootcamp. This project represents a significant step forward in my skills, as I'm moving beyond static web pages to build a dynamic, component-based application. This foundational experience is a key piece of my preparation for a career in the tech industry.

Technologies Used

React: The core technology for building this project, leveraging a component-based architecture for efficiency and reusability.

JavaScript: The primary language used to power the application's functionality.

HTML & CSS: The foundational languages for structuring and styling the user interface.

My Wins
This project allowed me to embrace new, powerful concepts and overcome challenges. My key wins include:

Building reusable React components to create a modular and organized codebase.

Using props to pass data down the component tree, ensuring dynamic and flexible content.

Practicing with state management to handle user interactions and update the UI in real-time.

Gaining more confidence in my ability to build modern, interactive web applications.

My Goals
My goal is to continue building my portfolio and solidify my technical skills as a foundational step toward a rewarding career in tech. This project is a crucial part of my plan to transition into remote work for Data Annotation.

Next Steps
This project is a work in progress! I'm actively building out new features and refining the application. Stay tuned for further updates as I continue to apply new skills from the bootcamp.
